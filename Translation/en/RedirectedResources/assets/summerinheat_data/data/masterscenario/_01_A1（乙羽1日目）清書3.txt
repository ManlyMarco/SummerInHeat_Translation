『Everytime I cried because my parents scolded me

Today, I saw a few students coming in, probably
here for club activities.

But maybe because they didn't know that I was a
replacement for the old man, they looked at me with
eyes full of suspicion as they bowed and quickly left.

Even if it was only natural for them to do that,
it made me sigh for a different reason.

...There was something I was hoping for from this
boring job, you see. Specifically, it was to be able
to sneak some views of the sort of school girls I liked.

But it was hard to find any.

If you looked at just their bodies alone, there
were a few passable ones but, that alone wasn't
enough for me to fap to them to.

Maybe I'd just watched too many pornos. The idea
that young schoolgirls = women you'd want to fuck
was deeply ingrained in my head.

Thinking about it, there were those two. They were in a
league of their own, even without my bias. Plus, their
rhythmic gymnastics would be a real sight for sore eyes.

But still, I couldn't exactly go waltzing in for a
look. Think, what can I do...

With thoughts like that in my head, I was in the
middle of sticking a half peeled away poster back
on the wall when--

？？？(CH01_0081)
『Hello there, uncle.』


I turned around in surprise at the adorable voice
that seemed to have changed the very mood in the
air.


***BGM_雲わすれの夏

***ST_オトハ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

Otoha-chan was standing right there. And seeing me
turn around, she started cheerfully walking
towards me.

***SE_ゆっくり足音_concrete normal_running_Mix

主人公
『Oh, you surprised me there. Hello, Otoha-chan.』

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0082)
『Uncle, thank you for your hard work.』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

I couldn't help but look at her with starved eyes.
She always had the same glossy skin, and clean
look to her.

And maybe because I'd just recently watched a
porno featuring a woman that looked almost like
her,

but even that 'neatness' of her style seemed to be
tempting, luring me in.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0083)
『...Uncle?』


主人公
『Nn, y-yeah. Come to think of it, today's... let's
　see, your extra lessons start from today, do
　they?』

Panicking, I somehow managed to dig something out
from my lust addled brain as I replied.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0084)
『No, not yet. Today's our last meeting with my

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0085)
『So I thought that maybe I'd come a bit earlier,
　just to familiarize myself with the school.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0086)
『I mean, you know... I'm really bad with
　directions, so I always get lost easily...』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0087)
『But I'm glad we got to meet again thanks to
　that.』


As I suppressed my desire to stare at her more, I
shot her a stiff smile and got a clear one from
her in return.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0088)
『Ah, and uncle, uhm... I'm sorry...』


主人公
『...What for?』

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0089)
『...The other day... I couldn't stop my mom at

主人公
『Hahahah... what, are you still worried about
　that?』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0090)
『Eh...』


主人公
『She's my older sister, so I've been used to it
　for longer than you've been alive, Otoha-chan.』

主人公
『And more than anything else, was it you who did
　it? No, right? So there's nothing for you to
　apologize for.』

主人公
『You tried to apologize for your mom back then
　too, and that helped me calm down, so I honestly
　forgot about it.』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0091)
『...Uncle.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0092)
『Thank you. You really are always so nice to me.
　You've always been like that, since I was little.』


主人公
『Hahahah, you're making a big deal out of it.
　You've always been a nice girl too, so it's only
　natural.』

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0093)
『Fufuh, thank you.』


As we talked, my eyes inevitably went down to her
body. Even now she hadn't noticed, so it was
probably fine.

主人公
『I thought as much when I saw you back then, but
　you really did grow and change a whole lot in the
　past few years.』

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0094)
『You think? I've grown bigger and stuff for sure
　but... I don't think I'm all that different
　inside... even now, I can't help but cling to you, uncle.』


主人公
『You were and still are adorable, so I don't mind
　at all.』

Especially when all I had to do was be nice to
her.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0095)
『Fufuh, you're praising me too much, uncle. I'm
　getting nervous now.』


主人公
『You know, that reminds me. The last time I
　remember you being seriously nervous was back when
　you left.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0096)
『The day I left?... Ah, 5 years ago...』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0097)
『A-Are you talking about... how I cried really
　hard... or maybe... a-about that... promise...?』


Aah, come to think of it... she did say something
like that, didn't she?

I'm remembering it now that she brought it up.

A promise, huh... what was it...?

主人公
『A promise...? What sort of promise was it?』

As I asked her, I was myself trying to remember
what it was she said that day.

And though vague, I remembered something.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み06_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0098)
『Eh... ah.. erhm....』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口困り_赤み06_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0099)
『E-Erhm... n-nothing... d-don't worry about it! It
　was nothing!』


...Looking at her reaction, it was probably "that
kind" of a promise.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み05_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽
『............』

But for now, let's pretend that I forgot about it.
It's not like it could ever come true.

I can't hope for more than eye-candy here.

主人公
『Sorry, I've been forgetting a lot of things
　lately. I must be getting old, hahahah.』

***ST_オトハ_A3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0100)
『N-Not at all! You're still super young, uncle...
　and not to mention... you know... uhm, erhmm...』


小鳥遊 乙羽
『..................』

Just what could she be thinking right now?

She brought up her naive words from 5 years ago,
and was almost brooding over them. I couldn't help
but be amazed at her innocence.

It'd be a shame to hurt her and distance myself
from her just because she's still naive though. So
I'll support her instead.

主人公
『What is it? Don't mind it, feel free to tell me
　anything, like you used to.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0101)
『Then, uhm... erhm....』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み06_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0102)
『Uhm--! ...U-Uncle, is there anyone that you're...
　dating... right now...?』


主人公
『Oh? Another one out of the blue there. Let's
　see... why do you want to know that?』

I slowly asked her, hiding my own surprise at the
unexpected question.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み06_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0103)
『That's... uhm... mom uh, never really talks about
　you so... I was wondering if you were already
　married or...』


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0104)
『T-That's not to say that I only want to know if
　you're married, or not. I just, I want to know how
　things are going for you, uncle.』


Looks like her mind wasn't far behind her growing
body, considering how sexually aware she was
getting.

『It was completely different from the bitter and
　sarcastic "What, still no girlfriend?" that my
　sister spat out every now and then.』

Though I was almost dazzled by her innocence, I
couldn't help but start feeling horny too.

主人公
『Hahahah, I see you're getting to that age
　yourself, huh? ...Marriage, huh? I do wonder.』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み06_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0105)
『Really, I'm sorry for asking something so weird
　out of the blue!』


主人公
『It's fine, it's fine. Say, Otoha-chan, did moving
　back here mean splitting up with someone you liked
　back there?』

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0106)
『N-No... there's nobody like that. Everyone over
　there was always just studying, so nobody had
　time.』


主人公
『I see, I see. You were working hard over there
　too, huh?』

The words "virgin as she looked" popped up in my
head.

...And they stirred up my lust like nothing else.
I couldn't help but want to defile a girl this
innocent, with my own two hands.

Even I'm not so far gone to think nothing of
thinking this way about my own niece but... that's
exactly why it felt immorally arousing.

***ST_オトハ_A3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0107)
『I did, a lot. But as you know...』


主人公
『It's fine. You've always worked plenty hard, and
　I know that. I think you're amazing. I'm proud of
　you.』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

A loud gong from the school clock resounded out
through the quiet hallway, notifying us of the
passage of time.

Just as I was on the clock still, the school was
always alive even through the summer, whether for
club activities or for extra classes.

『Wah--! I-I'm sorry, I gotta go! I'm sure both mom

As I watched her run off, I reflected over the
evil feelings I'd been suppressing through our
chat.

Otoha-chan knows too little about men, in every
sense of the word. "Defenseless" doesn't begin to
describe her.
