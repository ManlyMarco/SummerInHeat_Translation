The weather was so fine, the sunlight was bouncing
off basically everything - the school walls, the
ground, and even my own clothes.

But even though it was so sunny, the air was
almost steamy -- typical of midsummer humidity.

Even just standing still was enough to make sweat
run down from my forehead to my chin, down my neck
and all through my clothes.


***BGround_BG03_01


I worked as a live-in custodian, at a school in the
mountainous sticks. Since I was born and raised
here, this place was naturally my alma mater as well.

There were a lot less kids here now than back
then, so now they ran the place as a combined
junior-high school of sorts, to avoid closure.

It's easy to think of such a town in the sticks as
lush and cool and easier to live in the summer than
the city, even with all its inconveniences but...

...That wasn't the case at all. It's true there's
a lot of greenery here but, it's not like we're
surrounded by mountains on all sides either.

The montains are actually just about visible in the distance, and this place
is more of a flatland, with houses and lots of farms. There's an old
residential area that's been booming a bit too. Only the station's a bit more lively.

There's little to no entertainment to be had, and
even if you hurry, it takes at least an hour to
get to the city.

In such a place, where you see basically the same
people day in day out, it's only natural for it to
be a pretty closed off place.

There's nothing interesting here. It's the
countryside just like any other one in this
country.

And being a custodian in a place like this? Yeah,
I'm bored out of my mind.


***BGround_BG00_01

And what's more, it's the middle of summer. That's
to say, it's summer vacation. So I can't even look
at the young girls for mental comfort.

After plucking some weeds out of the ground, I
tried to take a breather in the shade, but in the
end I only lost what little water I had in my body.

主人公
『No wonder the old man collapsed.』


***SELoop_FadeOut
***BGround_BG99_01
***SE_footsteps_Asphalt_Trainers_Walk_Slow_x8_loop_mono

I started making my way back, to that hellish room
hotter than even the outside -- that is, the
custodian's room.

Let's go through the school buildings so that the
sun doesn't get me anymore than it already has.


***BGround_BG06_01
***BGM_夏空、静寂、蝉しぐれ
***SELoop_se_COCicadasILS2R_48khz_24bit_購入済み{45}

With it being summer, students basically didn't come
here, and I walked through the hallway filled with the
scent of summer. It was at least cooler than the outside.

That old man had been the custodian even longer
than I'd been a student here. Probably quite old
now. And with the summer hitting this hard...

He went into medical care to eventually return
but, someone had to do it while he was gone, and
so here I am.

I only just became the custodian a few days ago
actually, and since it's temp employment, it's no
different from a part time job.

主人公
『But I prefer it like this anyway.』

I wasn't the type to do most jobs for all that
long anyway.

It's not as if I've ever had an argument to the point
of quitting, or been fired for being useless but, no
matter what I do, I get bored and can't do it for long.

And I don't mean the sort of person that a
talented person feels at mastering a task, but
just things becoming less and less interesting over time.

As I learn to do a job, I start noticing efficiency
misses and shortcomings and whatnot. But I have
neither the energy nor the ability to fix those things.

So in the end, I just get fed up of doing things.
The gut and perseverance that I don't have much of
to begin with begin to die away.

And when that happens, it's just a matter of time
until I quit or back out.

主人公
『Come to think of it, it was the same with school
　club activities...』

***SE_School Playground with Movement_1_re

I turned my eyes towards the various club rooms,
full of noises.

I'm not under the delusion that I'm a model
worker, either. So I just prefer being a drifter,
as long as I can earn enough to eat.

I can't even bear the thought of becoming a
corporate slave when the pay was just as garbage.
I think the people who can are pretty amazing.

My parents found me a job on their own, pushed
some cash into my hands to "survive the first
month"

and then chased me out and into the city to be
independent but...

In the end, I quit every job I tried eventually, and
even my free time all I did was throw away money at
casinos and soaplands, which drained all my savings.

I'm not exactly happy with the pay here, but with
summer vacation, there wasn't much to do, so I'm
just grateful that I get to relax.

Thanks to it being live in, I can get away from
the constant nags about not having a proper job at
my age from my family... or rather,

mostly just my naggy elder sister.

...Now then, I wonder what I should do after
resting a bit...

？？？(CH01_0000)
『Ah! Uncle, hello.』


***Flash_In_Black


A voice clearly directed towards me echoed in from
behind, and I turned around.


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央


？？？(CH01_0001)
『...Am I bothering you?』


I was surprised.

A beautiful girl was standing right there.

She was shining even brighter than the linoleum
lined white floor.

In a word, she looked pure. And though she was
very graceful, she didn't have a harsh impression
to her at all.

If anything, she looked very gentle, maybe due to
her soft gaze.

...The atmosphere and voice suddenly reminded me
of something.

主人公
『Hey there... Otoha-chan?』

I ended up staring too much. Panicked, I called
out her name as if confirming it.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0002)
『Yeah, it's me, Otoha. I guess you didn't...
　recognize me?』


I didn't know she was here at school today.

This girl was Takanashi Otoha.

The reason I knew her name despite being slightly
unsure, was because she was my niece.

主人公
『It’s been quite a while since we actually met, so
　I wasn’t sure. I heard you were back here,
　though.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0003)
『I was a kid when we last met, so yeah.』


主人公
『Yeah. But your presence hasn't changed a bit.』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0004)
『Fufuh. I'm glad you knew it was me.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0005)
『So you really are working as the custodian here,
　huh?』


主人公
『That's right. As for you... I heard a lot
　happened, are you doing okay now?』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0006)
『Yeah, somehow. And I didn't think I'd see you
　here today so...』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口大笑い_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0007)
『So I feel a lot better now.』


It was hard to believe that such a sweet and good
girl was born to that naggy older sister of mine.

I used to play with her a lot when she was little,
so I knew her well.

主人公
『You've sure grown up a lot now.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0008)
『Fufuh, it's been 5 years so yeah.』


Her shy yet proud smile, typical of a girl her
age, was adorable.

***ST_オトハ_C2_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0009)
『I grew a whole lot taller too, didn't I?』


My eyes made their way to her other "growths" as
well. So 5 years can do this to a girl, huh?...

Her chest was asserting itself a lot more than in
the past. Her bodyline was slowly but surely
becoming curvier too.

Her overall figure looked very soft, and though
she still had her childlike innocence,

she was starting to exude a hint of femininity.
And that vague feeling was oddly alluring.

***ST_オトハ_C2_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_中央

Her hair was full of youth, and had a halo of the
most beautiful shine on it.

And her skin looked so firm and fine, it looked as
though it could repel all kinds of moisure, not
just sweat.

It made me want to stroke her, to savour the
texture of it with my own hands.

...I felt surprised at myself for feeling this
attracted to my own niece who I hadn't seen for a
long time.

Though she was my niece, the thought of wanting to
hold her with my own hands kept bothering me.

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0010)
『Un, cle...?』


I'd stared at her so long, she called out to me in
a troubled tone.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0011)
『I guess this uniform does bother you after
　all...?』


主人公
『Nn...?』

But it seemed that she was thinking of something
else entirely.

***ST_オトハ_C3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0012)
『This uniform's from my old school. I mean, this
　school's uniform's isn't a sailor style one, no?』


主人公
『Y-Yeah, it's not. It's summer now so you see a
　lot of students rocking half sleeves though.』

Taken aback by her sheer innocence, my panic ended
up bleeding out into my response.

Luckily, she didn't seem to have noticed that I
was looking at my own niece with those eyes.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0013)
『I tried to go and get the right one but, they
　were entirely out of my size.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0014)
『And apparently it's gonna take a while for a
　restock so...』


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0015)
『So I'll probably end up wearing this uniform for
　a bit. The school said it's fine too but...』


Though she was worried herself, I felt blessed by
my own luck at being able to see a student in a
sailor uniform.

主人公
『That does sound bothersome... but I think you can
　rock just about any outfit, whether it's this
　uniform or the normal one, Otoha-chan.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0016)
『T-Thanks, Uncle... But even if there's not many
　people around because of summer, I still stand out
　a bit, you know?』


Seeing her look so shy also sent a jolt through
me. I was getting turned on.

I was afraid that I'd end up using her as wank
material for later, if I didn't consciously stop
myself from doing so.

It'd be nothing but trouble if something like that
slipped out of my mouth now. Let's change the
subject...

主人公
『Ah yeah, you only got back here yesterday, didn't
　you? Onee-san got here a lot before you.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0017)
『Yeah. Mom came over first to deal with all the
　paperwork like changing our address and getting me
　registered here.』


So Otoha-chan had moved all the way here, huh?

Or rather, she'd moved away once, and then came
back here.

主人公
『Without your friends from school here, I bet
　it'll probably feel lonely. Feel free to talk to
　me whenever.』

Out of genuine concern for my niece... or rather,
out of ulterior motives, I suggested that.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0018)
『No, I'm okay.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0019)
『Back in the city... everyone's there was always
　just so focused on highschool entrance exams, so I
　don't have many good memories like that either.』


Not even realizing what sort of eyes I was looking
at her with, she fidgeted restlessly, to hide her
own emotions.

The soft fat on her fawn-like legs almost seemed
to be inviting me in.

主人公
『I see. It must have been hard.』

Trying my best to suppress my own arousal, I
thought back to her family situation.

Her parents... that is to say, my sister and
brother-in-law have education fever to the point

that they're famous in the area for it. "Fever"
honestly doesn't cut it... it's insane.

And with parents like that, Otoha-chan had her
path decided already, and that's why she moved, to
go to a famous high school.

The fact that she came back means she must have
failed the exam, in all likelihood.

Of course, that was probably not the only reason
but, that lump of pride that my sister is refused
to say a word.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み01_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0020)
『I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the mood down
　like this...』


主人公
『No, it's fine. Your uncle knows just how much of
　a hard worker you are despite everything, so don't
　worry.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0021)
『Thanks, uncle.』


Hearing her reply with genuine happiness, I just
couldn't help myself getting aroused.

She'd always had a pretty face but I never thought
she'd grow up this adorable.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0022)
『Ah and so you know, since the progress level of
　this school's much further than my old one... I'm
　going to take extra classes during summer.』


主人公
『Even though everyone's enjoying summer, huh? Life
　sure is hard for you, Otoha-chan.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0023)
『But studying is important, so you know.』


And she probably does think that way, I'm sure.
She does have the image of a studious girl in my
mind, after all.

Of course, no matter how she spends her own time,
her body will keep maturing at its own pace. When
I thought about how she

hadn't quite hit full maturity, and how her body
still had that unique charm and allure, I found my
gaze locked at her.

主人公
『You haven't changed a bit. Serious as ever.』

Though I said that, even I could tell that the
blood rushing to my lower half was making me
distracted.

Even at a soapland, I'd never be able to do it
with a girl as young as her, no matter how much I
cough up.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0024)
『I was actually on my way to talk to the teacher
　about the extra lessons and other stuff.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0025)
『I was feeling a bit lonely because I don't know
　anyone here but, knowing you're here makes me feel
　better, uncle.』


Even 5 years ago, I couldn't help but crave another
person's touch, so sometimes I'd pretend to stroke
her, and touch her in slightly sensitive places but...

It was never this bad. I never looked at her as a
proper woman like this, nor did I actually want to
lay my hand on her.

But if she's going to come to school for extra
classes... there might be a chance for something
or other.

Either way, she was pretty attached to me, so it
wasn't off the table.

***SELoop_FadeOut

？？？(CH03_0000)
『Otoha! So this is where you were, huh?』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口驚き_赤み00_中央


Suddenly, a voice that I could never bring myself
to like echoed through the hall, waking me up in
an instant.

Right behind Otoha-chan, there was a familiar
figure in the distance.


***SE_ヒール足音Footstep_Concrete_HighHeels

With the sound of footsteps, it made its way
closer and closer.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口困り_赤み02_中央

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口への字_赤み01_中央

This is, my older sister... Takanashi Reiko.

The silence of the hallway only made her
overbearing voice sound even harsher.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口つぐみ_赤み02_左１
***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口無表情_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0002)
『Did you even pay attention to the time?』


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0028)

　early.』


***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0003)
『That happens sometimes too. So isn't it just
　common sense to get there early yourself? It's a
　good thing I came early, since I didn't see you there.』


After laying down her barrage on Otoha-chan, who'd
basically curled up, she turned her gaze to me.

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目怒り_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0004)
『Hey, you. Aren't you at work?』


主人公
『...I am.』

I didn't want to deal with her. It was just bound
to be troublesome, or just put me in a bad mood.

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0005)
『So it's your job to hold my daughter up and talk

Just why does Reiko-nee-san... this bitch always
shovel out nothing but nastiness from her mouth?

Just one word from her is enough to make anyone
sick, I swear.

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0029)
『U-Uhm, mom, he wasn't holding me up, I saw him so
　I wanted to have a chat and...』


小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0006)
『So what? An adult who doesn't refuse that and
　wastes time standing around and chatting is to

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口つぐみ_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽
『............』

It wasn't 'just' because of Otoha-chan failing the
exam that they came back to this town.

No matter how much she herself didn't want to say
it, as family, there were some things that she
just couldn't hide.

She'd gotten divorced before she came back. I knew
that for sure, if nothing else.

In all likelihood, she probably pushed all the
responsibility for Otoha-chan failing the exam
onto nii-san and argued with him to death...

and got slapped with divorce papers in turn. No, I
was sure of it.

Personally, I'd never be caught dead marrying a
woman with a personality like hers, even if she
was a top class beauty.

***ST_レイコ_A3_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0007)
『And what are you gawking for? What happened to
　your actual work?』


小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0008)
『God knows how much trouble our mother must have
　gone through to find a job that even you could do.
　Or am I wrong?』


...She wasn't wrong. Our mother was the one who
found me this job.

It was true that I only got this job because I
knew my way around the place thanks to it being my
alma mater, and because of our family name.

But that's not to say that I asked her to do it.
She did that all her own.

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0009)
『So at least do it properly. Good grief...』


小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0010)
『A grown man like you, falling headfirst from one
　job to another... do you have no sense of
　responsibility or crisis, or something?』


Neither I was in a rush to respond, nor was
Otoha-chan in any position to.

And as for Reiko-nee-san, forget trying to fix
this atmosphere, she hadn't even noticed it.

主人公
『...God, will you shut up?』

***ST_レイコ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目怒り_口への字_赤み02_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0011)

I ended up blurting out. Or rather, I was at my
limit.

　than bitch all day long...』

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0012)
『What was that? You whispered something at the end
　there. If you've got something to say, how about
　saying it properly?』


Now that she's going, she won't stop anytime
soon... That really was a mistake.

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0013)
『Whose sake do you think I'm saying all this

Shame, huh... and does she think getting divorced
and running back home hasn't brought our family
any shame at all?

As I thought about it, my irritation kept
rocketing up... but when I saw Otoha-chan
shrinking back, I shook it off.

I should calm this situation somehow.

主人公
『...Anyways, you didn't come here for nothing,
　no?』

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0014)
『Of course. After I'm done talking to her homeroom
　teacher, I have things to take care of here as the
　PTA chair.』


I almost laughed out loud at her act of pretending
that she got that position through her own effort.

...In the end, she got it through using our
family's name, just like me.

Our family, the Takanashi family, was a pretty
heavyweight family in this town. But only here.

So we could throw our weight around a bit. That
was also something unique to the sticks. It was
honestly annoying.

No matter how much of an honours student she was,
and a proud alumna, someone who came back just

the other day after a few years can't just
suddenly rise all the way to the seat of PTA
chair.

In the end, she was as oblivious to that as she
was about everything else.

Seeing her about to burst into tears nearly made
me pop a vein. As if taken aback, Reiko-nee-san's
barrage stopped for a second.

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み01_右１

Her eyes swam around, as if embarrassed. Seems
like there was a mother in there somewhere.

『Mom, the time... W-We really will be late... Even
　uncle probably has work to do...』


Sensing that her momentum had weakened, Otoha-chan
forced out her small voice.

Things were no different 5 years ago...

I, the eldest son of the Takanashi family,
criticized for every single thing, no matter how
minor,

and Otoha-chan, the daughter of the family genius
Reiko-nee-san, wrung out to hell and back if she
got any less than a perfect score.

Though we were of different generations and
gender, we shared a camaraderie of sorts.

Our common enemy? Reiko-nee-san right here.

...That said, it wasn't as if she hated her own
mother, at best she just didn't get along with
her.

With that remark, she walked off, without even
looking giving a single glance back.

Forget feeling refreshed, I felt terrible. How
could anyone ever stand her...

She looked back several times as she left.

Seeing a girl as cute and gentle as her off was
enough to help my irritation melt away.

That said, just thinking of Reiko-nee-san's face
even for a moment was enough to make it boil up
again.

I was also tired out from the doing work outside.
Guess I'll go and take a nap in my 'room'.

But... before that, I'll use Otoha-chan as
masturbation material once.

As I walked, I heard the sound of some girls

It was... two of them. And they were coming this

『Ah... uncle!』


Otoha-chan noticed me, and her face lit up.

Drawn in by that voice, the other figure turned
towards me. As soon as she saw me, her eyes
widened.

In contrast to Otoha-chan's lifeliness, the girl
next to her clammed up after seeing me.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑_口微笑_赤み02_画面外
***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_中央

Just as she introduced, the silent girl next to
her was her childhood friend, Akatsuki Rino.

『...............』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

I was surprised when I saw Otoha-chan earlier but,
just as her eyes widened when she saw me,

I also couldn't help but be secretly surprised
that she was here.

...That said, it was a combined school, so it
wasn't that surprising that she just continued on.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口驚き_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0044)
『Huh? Has it been a while since you've seen uncle

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0001)
『A-Aah, yeah... it has, I guess. But, why is he
　here...』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0045)
『That's because he actually became the custodian
　here. Just the other day, even.』


***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0002)
『...Heh, I-I see. I didn't know.』


Unlike her usual docile self, Otoha-chan was
unusually lively and tried to get me to join in.

It was a night and day difference from Rino-chan.

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0046)
『Rino-chan, is something wrong?』


暁 莉乃(CH02_0003)
『No, nothing at all. I'm just still a bit
　surprised so...』


***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0047)
『Seriously, it's so surprising, isn't it? What a

***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0004)
『Y-Yeah.』


...I could understand why she was being so lively.

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

Rino-chan was Otoha-chan's closest friend. And the
only friend she had, honestly.

Thanks to Reiko-nee-san making studying her
absolute number one priority, she had almost no
friends, even though it was a small town.

And yet even with that, Rino-chan was someone who
always kept asking her to play with her anyway,
even keeping an eye on her.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み03_左１

She was a bit older than Otoha-chan but, she was
lively and cheery, and cared for her like her own
little sister.

In place of Reiko-nee-san, who was always busy
with something or other, I used to look after them
a lot.

I still remembered how she used to lead shy
Otoha-chan by the hand to new playgrounds and
rides she found.

Thanks to that, I'd known Rino-chan for a long
time myself as well.

主人公
『It's been a while, Rino-chan.』

***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_右１

『Yes, it has...』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口困り_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽
『...?』

Otoha-chan looked at Rino-chan's face with a
quizzical expression.

***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0006)

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0048)
『Nnn... I see. Nnn... makes sense. I guess I got a
　bit carried away.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

She continued, with a happy yet confused tone of
voice.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0049)
『Ah right, uncle. She's in the rhythmic gymnastics
　club. Isn't that amazing?』


***ST_リノ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口困り_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0007)
『O-Otoha...』


***ST_リノ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

主人公
『Hoh? Rino-chan in rhythmic gymnastics, huh?』

暁 莉乃(CH02_0008)
『Y-Yeah...』


When I heard the words "rhythmic gymnastics", I
immediately saw her in a leotard.

When the thought about her being in an erotic
outfit like that, one that hugged her bodyline
perfectly and hid nothing crossed my mind,

my eyes naturally went towards her body, as if
appraising it.

***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_右１

Compared to Otoha-chan, her body was more curvy
and feminine, fitting her age. And it looked quite
springy too.

Not bad at all. She was growing up perfectly into
my own tastes.

...No, I had to stop staring, else I'd just lose
my focus. We were talking, after all.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0050)
『I didn't join any clubs at my previous school so,
　I'm a bit jealous almost.』


***ST_リノ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

『Otoha. Why don't you come and watch our club
　activities sometime?』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0051)
『Okay. But I'm not very athletic so... I don't
　think I could ever do what you do.』


***ST_リノ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0010)
『I couldn't do it when I started out either.
　Everyone's bad at first, so why not give it a
　try?』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0052)
『O-Okay. You're right. I'll think about it if mom
　gives it the okay.』


***ST_リノ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口デフォ_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0011)
『Ah, right. I forgot about that. Your mom's pretty
　strict, isn't she?』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0053)
『Y-Yeah... sorry I don't have a clear answer for
　you even though you invited me.』


***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0012)
『No, it's fine. Don't apologize. It's not like I

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0054)
『...Thanks. You're so sweet, Rino-chan.』


Listening to them talk reminded me of how they
were as kids, and the time they'd spent apart
didn't seem to have changed them at all.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0055)
『Come to think of it, after I moved away, did you
　still go out to play with uncle?』


***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0013)
『...Nnn, you could say that.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0056)
『So after I left, did you keep going to that park
　we always went to?』


***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0014)
『Nn, well... I mean, it was 5 years or so ago, so
　I don't really remember it.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0057)
『Ah... O-Of course. ...It's all in the past, I
　guess.』


***ST_リノ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0015)
『Yeah.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口デフォ_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽
『....』

暁 莉乃
『...............』

The mood was flowing in an entirely different
direction to the lively one from before.

Otoha-chan looked back and forth between me and
her... but still didn't seem to know exactly what
to say.

***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0016)
『...Ah right, Otoha. You said you wanted to see
　the pool, right?』


***ST_オトハ_A3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0058)
『Yeah. My old school was just all studies and
　nothing else so we didn't have swimming lessons
　either.』


***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0017)
『I see. Well, we can use the pool here freely
　during summer as long as the swim club's not using
　it so...』


Hearing them talk, I imagined them in swimsuits
next.

I only became a custodian here after summer
started. So I hadn't yet gotten to see the pool
being used for lessons.

Normally, when the swim club's using it, a
teacher's usually there. But if it's just non-club
members, I might be able to catch a glimpse of them...

Now that's something to look forward to.

***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃
『..................』

As if seeing right through my thoughts, Rino-chan
pointed her sharp gaze at me.

主人公
『W-What's up?』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0059)
『Rino-chan...?』


暁 莉乃
『...............』

***ST_リノ_D1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

『Otoha, I'll help you fill out the application to
　use the pool. Come.』


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0060)
『Eh--...』


Having her arm grabbed out of nowhere, Otoha-chan
stumbled.

暁 莉乃(CH02_0019)
『Let's go.』


***ST_リノ_D1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_画面外

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口焦り_赤み02_画面外


***SE_走り去る足音_concrete normal_running_Mix


With a look on her face that screamed "I don't
understand what's going on", she was dragged away.

Soon enough, they were gone.

...And so I started walking again.

***SE_footsteps_asphalt_trainers_walk_slow_x8_loop_mono

I'll probably see Otoha-chan again when she comes
for her extra classes.

As for Reiko-nee-san, her naggy self could never
be bothered to come everyday. Even if I do see
her, I can just avoid her.

And then there's Rino-chan. I'll probably see her
too. I know now that she's a regular at the
rhythmic gymnastics club too.

That's a big harvest for a reunion like this.

I should finish my chores quickly and then plan
where to hang out tomorrow so that I can run into
them.

I suddenly had a lot of hope for the summer days
that I'd already written off as boring.

***FadeIn_InSide_Black


It'll probably be another bright and hot day
tomorrow. Summer's only beginning after all.
